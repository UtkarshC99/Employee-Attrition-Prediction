# Employee Attrition Prediction
 The COVID-19 pandemic has left many working professionals unemployed. As countries get pushed further towards the edge of the cliff and into an economic recession, analysis of the attrition of employees becomes vital to the HR department of an organisation, and to the future of a company. The dataset for this project was provided by IBM, and the problem statement was based on the Summer Analytics 2020 Capstone project.
